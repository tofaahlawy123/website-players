        <h1>Robben</h1>
        <div class="pen">


            He is a former Dutch football player, who used to play as a winger. He previously played for several
            European clubs, most notably Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. Robin is known for several skills,
            including dribbling, speed and the ability to penetrate and shoot from long distances accurately, especially
            as he uses his left foot from the right wing, and Robin was considered one of the best players in the world.
            He retired on June 27, 2020 and signed with FC Groningen for one season.



            In August 2009, Robben moved to Bayern Munich for around €25 million. In his first season in Munich, Bayern
            won the league title. This was Robben's fifth league title in eight years. Robben scored the winning goal in
            the 2013 Champions League Final, which was selected in the Champions League squad for this season. He also
            participated in the 2010 World Cup final, which the Netherlands lost to Spain. In 2014, he was named in the
            FIFA Squad of the Year and UEFA Squad of the Year, and fourth place in the Ballon d'Or award. In Germany, he
            won 20 titles, including eight in the German League and five in the German Cup

            Robben participated in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 European Championships, and the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World
            Cups. In the last tournament, he won the Bronze Ball award and was named to the tournament squad. In 2014,
            Robben came fourth in the Guardian's list of the 100 best players in the world.
