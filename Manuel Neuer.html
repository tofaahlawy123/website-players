            <br>
            A German footballer who plays as a goalkeeper, the Schalke 04 goalkeeper was the successor to former German
            goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. He is now the captain of Bayern Munich and the German national team, chosen by
            coach Joachim Loew to be the main goalkeeper of the German national football team in the 2010 World Cup in
            South Africa. He moved to Bayern Munich. A deal of twenty million euros. He is the brother of German referee
            Marcel Neuer. In 2013, he achieved the treble with Bayern Munich. In 2014, he won the World Cup with the
            German national team, and won the award for the best goalkeeper in the tournament. In the same year, Neuer
            was nominated for the European Player of the Year award and ranked second before his colleague Arjen Robben
            and behind Cristiano Ronaldo. In the 2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or, Neuer finished third behind Cristiano Ronaldo
            and Lionel Messi. In the same year he was named the third best player in the world by the Guardian
            newspaper. He has been awarded the best goalkeeper in the world by FIFA for four consecutive years (since
            2013-2016), and Manuel Neuer is considered one of the best integrated goalkeepers in the history of
            football.
